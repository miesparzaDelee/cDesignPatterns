## Factory Pattern

### Overview

Centralizes object creation. The factory decides which concrete shape to build and returns a unified polymorphic type (`shape_api_t*`). It hides the complexity of building the shape, initializing it, and assigning a vtable.

### Implementation

#### Factory Function

```c
shape_api_t* shapeFactory_create(shape_type_t type, void* config);
```

#### Internal Process

1. Allocate or use static memory for `api_rectangle_t` / `api_circle_t` / `api_triangle_t`
2. Initialize the underlying `shape_rectangle` / `shape_circle` / `shape_triangle`
3. Attach the correct vtable
4. Return `(shape_api_t*)`

### Important Notes

- Factory works best at the **VTABLE LAYER**, not the inheritance layer
- This allows the user to call `get_area`/`draw` generically regardless of shape type
- Cleanly hides creation logic and promotes modularity
