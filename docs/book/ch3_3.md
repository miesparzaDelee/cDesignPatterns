## 3.3 Opaque Pattern

### **Pattern Description**

The Opaque Pattern hides the implementation details of an object from its users by exposing only an abstract handle (`hOpaqueObject`).
This approach separates the interface from the implementation, promoting encapsulation and modularity.

The primary purpose of this pattern is to safeguard the internal state and behavior of an object, ensuring that users interact only through a well-defined API.
By preventing direct access to the object's internal structure, the pattern enhances stability and reduces the risk of accidental misuse.  

#### **Key Use Cases**

- Protecting sensitive or complex internal states from being modified directly.  
- Abstracting implementation details, allowing internal changes without affecting the API.  
- Explicitly managing memory allocation and deallocation for objects.

The Opaque Pattern uses an abstract handle (`hOpaqueObject`) to represent the object.
This handle is a typedef for an opaque pointer.
The actual structure is declared in the header file but defined only in the source file, ensuring the object's internal details remain hidden from external modules.

#### **Benefits**

- **Encapsulation**: Ensures that object internals are completely hidden from the user, improving modularity and maintainability.  
- **Flexibility**: Allows internal implementation to change without breaking external code, enabling easier updates and refactoring.  
- **Simplified Interface**: Exposes only the methods and data necessary for interacting with the object, reducing complexity for users.

### **Drawbacks**

- **Memory Management Complexity**: Requires users to explicitly allocate and free objects, increasing the risk of memory leaks if not managed properly.  
- **Performance Overhead**: Adds a slight runtime cost due to pointer dereferencing and the abstraction layer in function calls.

### **Implementation**

#### **Header File**

In the header file, the opaque object is declared as a pointer to an incomplete type.
This means the compiler knows the type exists but doesn’t know its contents.
Now it is just needed a future declaration of a `struct opaqueObject_t` within a source file.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

// Opaque object handle
struct opaqueObject_t;
typedef struct opaqueObject_t* hOpaqueObject;
```

The opaque object is represented by a handler (hOpaqueObject), which is a pointer to an incomplete type.
This handler acts as an interface for the user to interact with the object while keeping its internal structure hidden.
In the header, only a forward declaration (struct opaqueObject_t) is provided, meaning the compiler knows the type exists but not its contents.

This works because, in C, the compiler doesn’t need the full details of a structure to handle pointers to it—it just needs to know the type exists.
External code can use the handler (hOpaqueObject) to pass the object around or call API functions, but it cannot see or manipulate the internal fields.
The full definition of the structure is placed in the source file, ensuring strict encapsulation.
This setup allows the object’s internal implementation to change without affecting external code, as all interactions must go through the API.
It enforces a clear boundary between interface and implementation, keeping the design modular and maintainable.

The `opaqueObject_config_t` structure allows the user to provide parameters for initializing the object, while `oop_Init` and `oop_DeInit` handle object setup and cleanup.
For more details on this pattern, refer to the **[Object Pattern](#object-pattern)** section.

```c
// Configuration structure
typedef struct {
    uint32_t parameter1;
    uint32_t parameter2;
} opaqueObject_config_t;

// API initialization declarations
int oop_Init(hOpaqueObject me, opaqueObject_config_t* conf);
int oop_DeInit(hOpaqueObject me);
```

To interact with the opaque object, specific API functions are provided to set or retrieve its internal behavior or state.
These functions abstract away the implementation details, ensuring the internal structure remains hidden from the user.

```c
// API interaction functions
void oop_setParameter(hOpaqueObject me, uint32_t parameter);
uint32_t oop_getFlags(hOpaqueObject me);
uint32_t oop_getParameters(hOpaqueObject me);
```

These functions allow controlled access to the object's internal state. For example, `oop_setParameter` lets users modify the internal behavior of the object by setting specific parameters, while `oop_getFlags` retrieves operational flags that reflect the current state. Similarly, `oop_getParameters` provides a way to read the object's parameters without exposing its internal representation. By enforcing all interactions through these APIs, the opaque pattern ensures encapsulation and maintains modularity.

To create and manage opaque objects, API functions are provided for dynamic memory allocation and cleanup.
These functions support two common approaches: stack allocation and heap allocation.

```c
// API creation functions
size_t oop_size(void);
hOpaqueObject oop_new(void);
void oop_free(hOpaqueObject me);
```

The `oop_size` function returns the size of the opaque object, which can be used for stack allocation when integrating with memory-constrained systems.
On the other hand, `oop_new` dynamically allocates memory for the object on the heap using `malloc` and returns a handle to the user.
When the object is no longer needed, `oop_free` ensures the allocated memory is properly released and the handle is nullified, preventing dangling pointers.
Proper use of `oop_free` is essential to avoid memory leaks and ensure the integrity of the program.
By centralizing memory management, these functions enhance flexibility while maintaining control over object lifecycle.

##### **Header Key Points**

- **Opaque Pointer (`hOpaqueObject`)**: Declared as a pointer to `struct opaqueObject_t`, with the struct definition hidden in the source file to ensure encapsulation.  
- **Configuration Structure**: `opaqueObject_config_t` enables the user to pass initialization parameters while keeping internal details abstracted.  
- **Memory Management APIs**: Functions like `oop_size()`, `oop_new()`, and `oop_free()` centralize dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper object lifecycle management.  
- **Interaction APIs**: Methods like `oop_setParameter()`, `oop_getFlags()`, and `oop_getParameters()` provide controlled access to the object's internal state while enforcing modularity.

#### **Source File**

The opaque object is defined privately in the source file, including all internal fields needed to maintain its state.

```c
#include "opaquePattern.h"
#include <stdlib.h>

// Other declarations ..

// Opaque object definition

struct opaqueObject_t {
    uint32_t variable;
    uint32_t flags;
};
```

The struct `opaqueObject_t` represents the internal structure of the opaque object, which is completely hidden from external modules.
This encapsulation is a key feature of the Opaque Pattern, ensuring that the object's internal details can only be accessed or modified within the module itself.
The fields in this structure, such as variable and flags, are private and managed exclusively through the API, preserving the integrity of the object.

Initialization and de-initialization functions.

```c
// Initialization function
int oop_Init(hOpaqueObject me, opaqueObject_config_t* conf) {
    if (conf->parameter1 > 0) {
        me->variable = 1;
        me->flags |= OPAQUE_PATTERN_FLAG_1;
    }
    if (conf->parameter2 > 0) {
        me->flags |= OPAQUE_PATTERN_FLAG_3;
    }
    return 0;
}

// Deinitialization function
int oop_Deinit(hOpaqueObject me) {
    // Reset internal state if needed
    me->variable = 0;
    me->flags = 0;
    return 0;
}
```

The `oop_Init` and `oop_Deinit` functions manage the initialization and cleanup of the object, following a usage approach similar to the Object Pattern.
These functions ensure a consistent lifecycle for the object, allowing it to be reliably configured and reset.
The key difference lies in the opaque nature of the object's structure, which remains hidden from the user.
Instead of directly working with a visible structure, the user interacts through a handle (hOpaqueObject), while the internal details are managed entirely within the module.
This separation reinforces the encapsulation provided by the pattern, ensuring predictable behavior and modularity.

To interact with the object, methods are provided for setting parameters and retrieving the object's internal state.

```c
// Additional methods
void oop_setParameter(hOpaqueObject me, uint32_t parameter) {
    me->variable = parameter;
}

uint32_t oop_getFlags(hOpaqueObject me) {
    return me->flags;
}

uint32_t oop_getParameters(hOpaqueObject me) {
    return me->variable;
}
```

Notice how the `oop_setParameter` function updates the `variable` field, encapsulating the logic for modifying the object. Similarly,  the `oop_getFlags` method retrieves the current state flags, while `oop_getParameters` provides read-only access to the `variable`. These methods ensure external code interacts with the object in a modular and controlled manner.

Memory allocation and deallocation functions handle the creation and destruction of opaque objects.
This centralizes memory management, ensuring objects are properly allocated and freed.

```c
// Memory allocation functions
size_t oop_size(void) {
    return sizeof(struct opaqueObject_t);
}

hOpaqueObject oop_new(void) {
    return malloc(oop_size());
}

void oop_free(hOpaqueObject* me) {
    free(*me);
    *me = NULL;
}
```

The `oop_size` function provides the size of the opaque object, which can be used for stack allocation.
For heap allocation, `oop_new` dynamically creates an object and returns a handle.
The `oop_free` function ensures that memory is released when the object is no longer needed and nullifies the handle to avoid dangling pointers.
This approach ensures efficient memory usage while reducing the risk of leaks.

##### **Source Key Points**

- **Encapsulation**: The opaque object (`struct opaqueObject_t`) is defined privately in the source file, hiding all internal details from external modules. This ensures that only the module’s API can interact with or modify the object’s state.  
- **Lifecycle Management**: The `oop_Init` and `oop_Deinit` functions follow the same lifecycle principles as the Object Pattern but operate through an opaque handle (`hOpaqueObject`). This abstraction ensures modularity and consistent behavior while keeping the internal structure hidden.  
- **Controlled Interaction**: Methods like `oop_setParameter`, `oop_getFlags`, and `oop_getParameters` provide controlled access to the object’s internal state and behavior. These methods enforce the principles of encapsulation by restricting access to the internal structure.  
- **Memory Management**: Functions like `oop_new` and `oop_free` centralize memory allocation and cleanup. The `oop_size` function enables flexibility for stack allocation, while heap allocation is managed dynamically with `oop_new` and proper deallocation via `oop_free`. This approach minimizes memory management risks, such as leaks or dangling pointers.  

### **Module Repository and Example Usage**

The full implementation of the **Opaque Pattern** as a module and its unit tests are available in the [book repository](link).

Below is an example demonstrating the use of both stack-allocated and heap-allocated opaque objects:

```c
#include "opaquePattern.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <alloca.h>

int main() {
    // Stack-allocated opaque object
    hOpaqueObject stackObject = (hOpaqueObject)alloca(oop_size());

    opaqueObject_config_t stackConfig = { .parameter1 = 5, .parameter2 = 15 };
    oop_Init(stackObject, &stackConfig);

    // Use the stack-allocated object
    oop_setParameter(stackObject, 100);
    uint32_t stackFlags = oop_getFlags(stackObject);
    uint32_t stackParams = oop_getParameters(stackObject);

    printf("Stack Object - Flags: %u, Params: %u\n", stackFlags, stackParams);

    // Deinitialize the stack-allocated object
    oop_Deinit(stackObject);

    // Heap-allocated opaque object
    hOpaqueObject heapObject = oop_new();

    opaqueObject_config_t heapConfig = { .parameter1 = 10, .parameter2 = 20 };
    oop_Init(heapObject, &heapConfig);

    // Use the heap-allocated object
    oop_setParameter(heapObject, 200);
    uint32_t heapFlags = oop_getFlags(heapObject);
    uint32_t heapParams = oop_getParameters(heapObject);

    printf("Heap Object - Flags: %u, Params: %u\n", heapFlags, heapParams);

    // Deinitialize and free the heap-allocated object
    oop_Deinit(heapObject);
    oop_free(&heapObject);

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the flexibility of the **Opaque Pattern** by showcasing both stack and heap allocation for opaque objects.

The stack-allocated object uses `alloca` to dynamically allocate memory on the stack for the opaque object.
This method uses the size of the object provided by `oop_size`. The handle, `stackObject`, points to this stack-allocated memory, and the object is initialized using the configuration provided in `stackConfig`.
After initialization, API functions like `oop_setParameter`, `oop_getFlags`, and `oop_getParameters` are used to interact with the object.
Finally, `oop_Deinit` resets the object’s state, but no explicit cleanup is required because the memory is automatically reclaimed when the function exits.

The heap-allocated object is created using `oop_new`, which allocates memory on the heap and returns a handle to the user.
Similar to the stack-allocated object, the heap object is initialized, used, and de-initialized through the API.
However, heap allocation requires explicit cleanup: `oop_Deinit` resets the state, and `oop_free` releases the allocated memory and nullifies the handle.
