## 3.4 Private Pattern

### **Pattern Description**

The Private Pattern is a design approach that strikes a balance between full encapsulation and practical exposure of key elements.
Unlike the opaque pattern, which fully hides all internal details and typically requires dynamic memory allocation, the Private Pattern supports static memory allocation and provides selective visibility.
It exposes only the necessary fields and functions through a public header, while isolating private implementation details within a private header using a single source file.

This separation of public and private components ensures that critical internals remain protected while giving users controlled access to essential elements.
The public header serves as the defined interface, exposing minimal details required for functionality, such as configuration parameters or status fields.
The private header or source file manages the internal data structures and logic, shielding them from external access.
This design fosters modularity and encapsulation while allowing for flexibility in static allocation scenarios, making it ideal for systems with constrained resources or predictable memory requirements.

#### **Key Use Cases**

The Private Pattern is well-suited for systems where complete encapsulation is impractical or where controlled access to internal elements simplifies interaction.
It is particularly advantageous in embedded systems or environments with limited memory, as it supports static allocation, avoiding the complexities and overhead associated with dynamic memory.
This pattern is also beneficial in collaborative development contexts, where partial visibility can streamline integration and debugging without compromising the core system's modularity and security.

#### **Benefits**

A major advantage of the Private Pattern is its compatibility with static memory allocation, which is essential in resource-constrained or real-time systems.
By exposing only the necessary components through the public header, this pattern avoids the rigidity of the opaque pattern while preserving encapsulation for sensitive data.
The clear distinction between public and private components ensures that internal details are well-protected, minimizing the risk of unintended modifications or dependencies.

This selective exposure simplifies integration and debugging, as users can interact with the module using clearly defined interfaces while remaining unaware of the underlying complexity.
The pattern promotes maintainability and scalability by allowing developers to update internal implementations without impacting the external API.
Overall, it provides a practical and efficient solution for achieving modularity and encapsulation without sacrificing usability or flexibility.

#### **Drawbacks**

Despite its advantages, the Private Pattern introduces additional complexity by requiring a structured division of public and private components, often necessitating multiple files and additional maintenance.  
This can increase the development overhead, especially for smaller teams or projects with limited resources.  
The pattern may also lead to slight performance trade-offs in scenarios where accessor functions are needed to interact with private data.  

An important limitation of this pattern is that it does not explicitly prevent the usage or modification of private elements, as these details remain accessible within the implementation.  
The pattern relies on users adhering to the convention of interacting with the module solely through the public headers and avoiding direct manipulation of private elements.  
This dependency on disciplined usage can introduce risks in cases where the guidelines are not strictly followed.  

Debugging can also become more cumbersome, as private details are intentionally hidden and require deliberate effort to inspect or modify internal states during troubleshooting.  
However, these drawbacks are often outweighed by the long-term benefits of improved code robustness and maintainability, particularly in environments that prioritize modularity and resource efficiency.

### **Implementation**

#### **Header Files**

The implementation of the Private Pattern relies on a division between public and private headers to provide selective access while encapsulating internal details.
This approach ensures that only the necessary elements are exposed to users, while the internal workings remain protected. Below, we explain the key aspects of the provided headers and their roles in implementing the pattern.

The public header file defines the structure and interface accessible to external users of the module:

```c
{{ file "src/patterns/include/oppaquePattern.h" struct="privateStruct" }}  

{{ file "src/patterns/include/oppaquePattern.h" typedef="hPrivateObject_t"}}

#include "privatePatternPrivate.h"

{{ file "src/patterns/include/oppaquePattern.h" struct="privateStruct" }}
```

n this design, `privateStruct` serves as the primary structure for the module, while a handle (`hPrivateObject_t`) is provided to users to abstract direct access to the structure.
The member `privateData`  contains all the non-public information of the module's structure.
This is achieved by including a private data structure (`_privateObject_t`) within the public structure.
It is a recommended practice to prefix the name of the private data structure with an underscore to clearly identify it as private.

The definition of `_privateObject_t` resides in the private header file, as shown below:

```c
{{ file "src/patterns/include/privatePatternPrivate.h" struct="_privateObject_t" }}
```

The `_privateObject_t` structure contains fields, such as `parameter1` and `flags`, which are used internally by the module but are hidden from external access.
This ensures that the module's private details are isolated from the user's code, promoting encapsulation and preventing unintended modification.

By including `privatePatternPrivate.h` within the public header, the module allows the public structure to reference its private counterpart.
However, users are discouraged from directly including or modifying the private header in their implementations.
This separation enforces a clear boundary between the public interface and the private details of the module.

The public header also declares functions regular object pattern  functions i.e. for initialization and de-initialization, along with any necessary configuration structures:

```c
{{ file "src/patterns/include/privatePattern.h" typedef="privateObject_config_t" }}

{{ file "src/patterns/include/privatePattern.h" function="privPatt_Init" }}

{{ file "src/patterns/include/privatePattern.h" function="privPatt_DeInit" }}
```

#### **Source File**

The source file contains the core implementation of the Private Pattern, showcasing how the public and private components interact.  

The initialization function is enough to illustrate how the private elements of the module are accessed and modified using the public interface:

```c
{{ file "src/patterns/privatePattern.c" function="privPatt_Init" }}
```

In this function, configuration parameters (`parameter1` and `parameter2`) are used to initialize private fields.
The private data, stored within `privateData` in the `this` handle, is accessed and modified directly.
This approach ensures that users interact with the private elements only through the public API, maintaining encapsulation.

When the private structure is large or complex, dereferencing the privateData member into a local pointer can improve readability and handling.
This technique simplifies access to the private fields, reducing repetitive syntax:

```c
{{ file "src/patterns/privatePattern.c" function="privPatt_InitLarge" }}
```

Notice the underscore before `_self` that is used to indicate that we are dealing with the private part of the object.

### **Example Usage**

Below is an example demonstrating the use private objects:

```c
#include "privatePattern.h"

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize a privateStruct instance
    struct privateStruct privateObject;
    hPrivateObject_t hPrivateObject = &privateObject;

    // Configuration for initialization
    privateObject_config_t conf = { .parameter1 = 5, .parameter2 = 15 };

    // Initialize the private object
    privPatt_Init(hPrivateObject, &conf);

    // Deinitialize the private object
    privPatt_DeInit(hPrivateObject);

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, an instance of `privateStruct` (`privateObjectInstance`) is declared and initialized using the `privPatt_Init` function.  
A configuration structure (`conf`) is defined to specify the initialization parameters.  

- `parameter1` is set to `5`, which activates logic enabling `PRIVATE_PATTERN_FLAG_1`.  
- `parameter2` is set to `15`, which enables additional logic, setting `PRIVATE_PATTERN_FLAG_3`.  

During initialization, the object's `privateData.flags` field is updated based on the configuration values.  
The flags indicate the operational state of the object, allowing structured control over its behavior.  

The example demonstrates how the **Private Pattern** maintains encapsulation by using a handle (`hPrivateObject_t`) to reference the object without exposing its internal details.  
This ensures that access to private members is restricted, improving modularity and maintainability.  

Finally, `privPatt_DeInit` is called to clean up `privateObjectInstance`.  
This step ensures the object is properly reset, preventing unintended residual states and preparing it for future reuse.
