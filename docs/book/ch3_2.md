## 3.2 Object Pattern

### Pattern Description

The Object Pattern encapsulates state and behavior in a modular, reusable structure, allowing for multiple independent instances of the same functionality.
Its main purpose is to create self-contained objects with well-defined APIs that operate independently of each other.
The best usage cases for this pattern include the following:

- Managing multiple instances of a resource or component (e.g., multiple sensors, devices, or configurations).  
- Abstracting state and behavior into a reusable structure.  

This pattern uses a structure definition, such as `object_t` (see recommended practice for naming structs), to encapsulate the internal state of an instance.Object structs can be created statically or dynamically, depending on the needs.
It is recommended to leave the responsibility of object allocation to the module user (upstream code).  

Functions operate on instances passed as pointers, which are usually named `me` within an API (see recommended practice for naming objects).
The object state and behavior are encapsulated in its definition, and no state is retained within any of its handling functions.
All struct members must be **read-only** and can be accessed directly but should only be modified through API functions.
Each object must include an initialization function (`Init`) that sets the initial state. This function may optionally accept a configuration parameter to allow user-specific configuration.  

#### Benefits

- Allows for multiple independent instances of a module.  
- Promotes modularity by isolating state and logic.  
- Improves code readability and maintainability.  

#### Drawbacks

- Requires explicit memory management by the module user.  
- Slightly increases function call complexity due to instance-specific pointers.
- Exposes the object state and internal behavior to the user.  

### **Implementation**

#### **Header File**

The header file defines the object’s structure and declares the APIs that users can call to interact with the object.
Let’s start by looking at the object structure:

```c
// Object structure definition
#include <stdint.h>

typedef struct
{
    uint32_t variable;  // Represents an operational variable
    uint32_t flags;     // Represents operational states or conditions
} object_t;
```

This `object_t` structure is the core of the Object Pattern. It encapsulates the state of an individual object instance.
In this case, we have:

- **`variable`**: A general-purpose field that can hold instance-specific data, such as a sensor reading or a configuration setting.
- **`flags`**: A bitfield that efficiently represents the operational state of the object. Flags allow the code to handle multiple states or conditions simultaneously using bitwise operations.

To configure the object during initialization, we use a separate configuration structure:

```c
// Configuration structure definition
typedef struct
{
    uint32_t parameter1;  // Configuration parameter 1
    uint32_t parameter2;  // Configuration parameter 2
} object_config_t;
```

The `object_config_t` structure separates configuration details from the object’s state. This design keeps the object clean and flexible, allowing for different configurations to be applied without modifying the object directly.

Finally, the APIs for initializing and de-initializing the object are declared like this:

```c
uint32_t op_Init(object_t* me, object_config_t* conf);

uint32_t op_DeInit(object_t* me);
```

These functions provide the interface for setting up and resetting the object.
The `me` parameter represents the specific object instance being operated on, which allows the same API to manage multiple instances.
This approach is modular and ensures that state management is always instance-specific.

#### **Definition Key Highlights**

- **Encapsulation**: The `object_t` structure keeps the object’s internal state isolated, while the configuration is passed through `object_config_t`.
- **Modularity**: The user of the module is responsible for creating and managing instances, making the design flexible for various applications.
- **Readable API**: Naming the object parameter `me` makes the intent of the API clear—operations are always tied to the specific object instance.

#### **Source File**

The source file contains the implementation of the APIs declared in the header. Below is an example of how the initialization and de-initialization functions are implemented.

```c
#include "objectPattern.h"
#include <string.h>

// Bit-flag definitions
#define OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_1 0x1
#define OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_2 0x2
#define OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_3 0x4
```

The implementation of the initialization function `op_Init` is shown below:

```c
uint32_t op_Init(object_t* me, object_config_t* conf)
{
    // De-initialize the object to reset its state
    op_DeInit(me);

    // Initialize based on configuration
    if (conf->parameter1 > 0)
    {
        me->variable = 1;  // Set the variable if parameter1 is positive
        me->flags |= OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_1;  // Enable FLAG_1
    }
    if (conf->parameter2 > 0)
    {
        me->flags |= OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_3;  // Enable FLAG_3
    }
    return 0;  // Return success
}
```

This function starts by calling `op_DeInit` to reset the object state, ensuring consistent initialization.
It then uses the user-provided configuration (`conf`) to initialize the object.
For instance, `parameter1` and `parameter2` dictate whether certain flags (`OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_1` or `OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_3`) are enabled, while the `variable` field is updated based on these inputs.
The proposed usage of flags that uses bitwise operations is recommended since it is  efficient and allows multiple independent states to be represented within the same variable.

The de-initialization function `op_DeInit` is implemented as follows:

```c
uint32_t op_DeInit(object_t* me)
{
    // Reset the object state
    memset(me, 0, sizeof(object_t));
    return 0;  // Return success
}
```

This function clears the memory of the object, effectively resetting all its fields to zero.
In more complete implementations, all states and initialized components should be returned to a default state.
The de-initialization process ensures the object is left in a condition ready to be initialized again, potentially with a different configuration if needed.

#### **Implementation Key Highlights**

- **Initialization Logic**:
  - `op_Init` ensures the object is always initialized in a consistent state by first de-initializing it.
  - User-provided configuration (`object_config_t`) is used to customize the object during initialization.
- **State Management**:
  - `op_DeInit` ensures the object is cleared before reuse, preventing unintended behavior from leftover state.
- **Efficient Flag Management**:
  - Bitwise operations on `flags` allow efficient representation and manipulation of multiple states or conditions.

### **Module Repository and Example Usage**

The full implementation of the **Object Pattern** as a module and its unit tests are available in the [book repository](link).

Below is an example of how to use the module:

```c
#include "objectPattern.h"

int main() {
    // Declare and allocate an object instance
    object_t myObject;
    object_config_t config = {
        .parameter1 = 5,  // Configuration value for parameter1
        .parameter2 = 0,  // Configuration value for parameter2
    };

    // Initialize the object with configuration
    op_Init(&myObject, &config);

    // Access the object fields
    if (myObject.flags & OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_1) {
        // Perform specific action when FLAG_1 is set
    }

    // De-initialize the object when done
    op_DeInit(&myObject);

    return 0;
}

In this example, an instance of the object (myObject) is declared and initialized using the op_Init function.
A configuration structure (config) is defined to specify the initialization parameters.
Here, parameter1 is set to 5, which activates the logic for enabling OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_1, while parameter2 is left at 0, so no additional flags are enabled.

The initialization function sets the state of myObject based on the provided configuration.
After initialization, the example demonstrates how to use the flags field of the object.
It checks if OBJECT_PATTERN_FLAG_1 is set and performs an action accordingly.
This illustrates how the object’s state can guide application logic in a modular way.

Finally, the object is de-initialized using the op_DeInit function, which resets the state of myObject.
This step ensures the object is cleaned up and ready for reuse or safe disposal, highlighting the importance of proper de-initialization in modular design.
